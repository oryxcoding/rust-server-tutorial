## How to update server vanilla/modded
Updating server will not affect the server data unless it was patch from force wipe. I recommand checking/updating before every wipe, We will assume for now that force wipe just came out and we will update the server.
### Vanilla:
Locate the `start.bat` located at `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\rust\server`. This will execute any updates *VANILLA* then start the server.

### MODDED:
MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE VANILLA SIDE FIRST. in moddded you need to grab files from umod[https://umod.org/games/rust] website and click on download.
